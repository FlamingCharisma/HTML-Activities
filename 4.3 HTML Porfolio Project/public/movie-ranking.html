<h1>THE BEST MOVIES ACCORDING TO JOSHUA</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Black Panther</h3>
<p>
There are a lot of things i love in this movie: <br/>
1. The characters <br/>
2. The Computer Graphics <br/>
3. The Story Itself  <br/>
4. The representation of black people <br/>
</p>
<h3>Hidden Figures</h3>
<p>
In this movie, I love how the main characters fight for their positions throughout the story. Each character has their own struggles, but they gain their positions through hard work. I also appreciate how they support each other.

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>
I just binged watch the movies under this anime and all of them are so good.
